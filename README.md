Have the ability to analyze any inputted bracket and output a file detailing 
the analysis 


Opening move names are decided once black makes a move 
Look only at games where white makes move 'x', x is chosen by user. Focus on 'e4' for report
Look at brackets -> [800, 1400), [1800, 2400) 

query only games where 'e4' is the first move 

	-Most common response move(s), least common resposne move(s) 
		-wins/loss ratio for only the opening moves that were used (for black)
	-how many wins were upsets with black as the lower rated player 
	-how many wins were upsets with white as the lower rated player 
	-counts of each opening 




Maybe 
	
	-Check upsets and rating consistent games per opening move type
	-What opening move(s) are effective against opening move X? 

**upsets defined as lower rated person winning against a higher rated regardless 
  of how small or large the rating difference is
